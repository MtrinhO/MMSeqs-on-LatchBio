# MMSeqs-on-LatchBio

Welcome to the MMSeqs-on-LatchBio project! Here, I'm trying to bring the many functionalities of the MMSeqs2 software suite to the no-code Latch SDK intereface.

Currently, we offer the following workflows of the MMSeqs2 suite:
- easy-search (Offline)
- easy-cluster (Coming Soon)
- easy-taxonomy (Coming Soon)
- easy-linclust (Coming Soon)
